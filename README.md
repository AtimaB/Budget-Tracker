# Budget-Tracker

For this assignment, I create a Budget Tracker application to allow for offline access and functionality.<br>

The user will be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. When entering transactions offline, they should populate the total when brought back online.

Offline Functionality:

- Enter deposits offline

- Enter expenses offline

When brought back online:

- Offline entries should be added to tracker.
